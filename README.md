## How it works

Any reasonable event definition can be added here. Implementation and how-to-use guides must exist elsewhere.

The entire thing exists in a single YAML file (with lots of aliases such that common tag definitions don't have to be repeated) and can be used to automatically validate events (by relays at the time of event ingestion, for example).
